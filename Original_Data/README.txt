This folder contains contaminant concentration, detection limit, and quality assurance/control data for smallmouth bass ovary, juvenile, and testes data collected from river sampling sites in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. This folder contains two additional folders, 'Fish Tissue Data (Unedited)' and 'Fish Tissue Data (edited)' -- differences are described below. 

The 'Fish Tissue Data (Edited)' folder contains all the same data as 'Fish Tissue Data (Unedited)' but within each excel spreadsheet in the edited folder, there is an additional tab in which the data were re-formatted for use in the R programming environment. This new tab (not included in the excel spreadsheets of the unedited folder) is called 'Combined'. Additionally, a new row labeled 'Tissue Type' was added to the edited spreadsheets to indicate tissue type: 'Ovary' for ovary tissue samples and 'YOY' for juvenile tissue samples. Finally, a new row was added to each edited spreadsheet to indicate the sampling site using a new site ID system that was created for the analysis. These were:

ANT: Antietam Creek
BE: Bald Eagle Creek
CHIL: Chillisquaque Creek
LOY: Loyalsock Creek
MON: Monocacy Creek
PC: Pine Creek
POT: South Branch Potomac River
SUSHA: Main Branch Susquehanna River (Harrisburg)
WBC: West Branch Mahantango Creek
WBC_E: West Branch Mahantango Creek (early samples)
WBMC: West Branch Susquehanna River at Mcelhattan
WYA: Wyalusing Creek



Additional information about each spreadsheet can be found below:

Quality Assurance Information: This is a document that C.McClure created to compile all quality assurance and control information from all spreadsheets into a single excel spreadsheet.

Site_ID_Info: A document that contains site ID, year, tissue type, and site name information.

Tissue Sample List_CERC: A document that contains additional information on tissue types at various sampling sites.

Detection_Limits: This is a document that C.McClure created to compile detection limits for each compound from each of the spreadsheets above. It includes detection limits for ovary, juvenile, and testes samples.
