Code for the Bayesian hierarchical censored regression models analyzing contaminant concentrations in smallmouth bass ovary and juvenile full-body tissue across various river sites in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. 

All necessary data to run the concentration analysis is found in the Concentration Analysis folder (labeled All_Compounds_Cleaned.csv and Upstream_Immediate_totals.csv). Additional unedited data is found in the Data folder. 

Description of R Scripts:

Concentration_Analysis_Part1.R is model code for running the concentration analyses that evaluate the land-use effects on the concentration of contaminants in juvenile-only tissue and ovary-only tissue. Included in the script is plotting code and code to pull various estimates from the model output into tables and matrices.

Concentration_Analysis_Part2.R is model code for running the concentration analysis that evaluates the differences in contaminant concentration between juvenile tissue and ovary tissue.Included in the script is plotting code and code to pull various estimates from the model output into tables and matrices.
